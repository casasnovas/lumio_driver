1. Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.1 For the driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To be able to compile this driver, some dependencies are neeeded : 
   - gcc
   - kernel-headers (it's called linux-headers on ubuntu and debian-like)
   - glibc-headers
   - libusb
   - libusb-devel (libusb-dev on ubuntu and debian-like)
libusb is not directly needed by this driver, but for a small utility which
detach the kernel from the touchcreen before loading this driver. Otherwize the
kernel takes care of the touchscreen and this driver is not able to communicate
with it.

1.2 For the draw_mice programm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you want to use this touchscreen with xorg-server >= 1.7 and be able to use
multiple fingers directly, you'll also need:
   - libXi-dev >= 1.3
   - libX11-dev >= 1.3
   - xorg-server >= 1.7
Those dependencies are required if you want to build the "draw_mice" program,
which is an example program, a paint-like, with which you're able to draw on
the screen with multiple fingers.


2. Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To install this driver correctly, just do the folowing in the extracted
directory containing the driver:
  42sh$ make
As root:
  42sh$ make install
Now you can plug the device, and type this command:
  42sh$ lumio_load_driver


3. Checking the driver is running
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can verify that the driver is working by finding the two char devices it
has created , it should appear as /dev/input/lumio1 and /dev/input/lumio2.


4. What more ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You probably want to check that your touchscreen is working correctly, you can
do so compiling the example program draw_mice by typing, in the check
directory:
  42sh$ make
Now, you probably want to add multiple fingers on your screen, to do so type
the following:
  42sh$ lumio_create_cursors

You should have noticed that one cursors has appeared in the center of your
display. In fact there are two cursors but you only see one because they are at
the exact same place.

Anyway, now here the most interesting part, you probably wanna draw with 2
fingers, right ? To do so, just type:
  42sh$ ./draw_mice
It should open a black window, move your fingers in it, it should draw on the
screen :)


5. Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
5.1 Errors when compiling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Please triple-check that you have all dependencies needed. If you have
everything and still the driver doesn't compile, please send-me an e-mail at
quentin.casasnovas@gmail.com with the output of the make command. Please also
tell me the distribution and kernel version you are running.

5.2 lumio_load_driver: command not found
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If there's an error message saying that "lumio_load_driver" is not found, check
that the directory /usr/local/bin is part of your PATH:
  42sh$ echo $PATH
If it's not part of your PATH :
  42sh$ export PATH="/usr/local/bin:${PATH}"

5.3 lumio_create_cursors error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If there's an error when you try to run the script lumio_create_cursors, it
probably means that you don't have the xinput program. It is needed to add new
cursors on the screen, this utility should be included in x11-utils-app or
there may even be a package called xinput on your distribution. You can check
that you have it by typing:
  42sh$ xinput
If you got "command not found" then you don't have it, and you should search
the package in your distribution that contains it.

5.4 ./draw_mice doesn't run and end up with an error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You probably don't have xorg-server >= 1.7 running on your computer. You should
upgrade it to at least 1.7 if you want to use the draw_mice programm.

5.5 Something else ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If there is a problem not listed here, and all dependencies are installed on
your computer, feel free to send me an e-mail with all details (the error, your
distribution, your kernel version, etc).


6. When you're finish testing...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Each time you unplug the touchscreen, don't forget to remove the driver:
  42sh$ rmmod lumio_driver
When you re-plug it, simply reload the driver:
  42sh$ lumio_load_driver

 /!\----------
| ! | Don't forget that the driver won't be loaded at next boot, and for now it
| ! | cannot be like that (the hid driver attaches it before lumio_driver).
