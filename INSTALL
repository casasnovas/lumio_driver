To install this driver correctly, just do the folowing:
  42sh$ make
As root:
  42sh$ make install

You can verify that the driver is working by finding th devices it has created
in /dev/input, it should be event{n, n+1} or mouse{n, n+1} depending on many
things. Once you've find what are the devices, just do a :
  42sh$ cat /dev/input/eventX
and move your fingers on the touchscreen, if you see strange characters on your
terminal, it means the driver is well installed :)

 /!\----------
| ! | Don't forget that the driver won't be loaded at next boot, to do so, follow
| ! | instructions corresponding to your distribution.
