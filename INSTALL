To install this driver correctly, just do the folowing:
  42sh$ make
As root:
  42sh$ make install
Now you can plug the device, and type this command:
  42sh$ lumio_load_driver

If there's an error message saying that "lumio_load_driver" is not found, check
that the directory /usr/local/bin is part of your PATH:
  42sh$ echo $PATH
If it's not part of your PATH :
  42sh$ export PATH="/usr/local/bin:${PATH}"

You can verify that the driver is working by finding the char devices it has
created , it should appear as /dev/input/lumio1 and /dev/input/lumio2.

Each time you unplug the touchscreen, don't forget to remove the driver:
  42sh$ rmmod lumio_driver
When you re-plug it, simply reload the driver:
  42sh$ lumio_load_driver

So now the driver is working and is taking care of your touchscreen, but still
the xorg-server multiplex it with your current mouse. What you probably want to
do is to create multiple cursors on the screen (you would need at least
xorg-server 1.7 to do that). If you want to do it by hand, you should see the
manual page of xinput command. But for your convenience, the driver provide you
with a helper script that create the differents cursors, just type:
  42sh$ lumio_create_cursors

 /!\----------
| ! | Don't forget that the driver won't be loaded at next boot, and for now it
| ! | cannot be like that (the hid driver attaches it before lumio_driver).
 \!/----------

You probably want to check that your touchscreen is working correctly, you can
do so compiling the example programm draw_mice by typing in the check
directory:
  42sh$ make
Once it is done, you can run the programm and draw with 2 fingers:
  42sh$ ./draw_mice
